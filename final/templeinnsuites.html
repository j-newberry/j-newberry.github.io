            hotel accommodations near temple locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around the 
            world. The owner-operated company caters to temple workers, patrons, and their families by providing specialized

            offers to meet the needs of temple patrons who come to serve in the temple or who participate in events such 
            as sealings, weddings, receptions, and youth trips. The website should reflect the Church culture and be designed
            to support a temple oriented theme as well as the concept of being a haven of comfort and accessibility.
