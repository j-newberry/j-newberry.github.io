                <h3>Proximity</h3>
                <a href="https://pinterest.com" target="_blank">See Pinterest here</a>
                <p>This website has great proximity, or spacing. The images are all the same distance apart, around all edges. This makes the mobile site app so appealing to the eye because you don't have to look all over at some really weird spacing, instead you're looking at very pleasantly spaced images. The spacing helps in terms of organization as well. </p>

                <p>On Twitter, everything is in great alignment. From profile pictures on the left, to the edges of text, to the comment, like, retweet, and share buttons. Each tweet is the same distance apart, which plays an important part in alighnment. All around Twitter is an excellent example of alignment.  </p>
