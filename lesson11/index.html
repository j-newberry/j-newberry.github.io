        <h2 id="content" class="article_title">April Showers Take A Rain Check</h2>
        <p id="content" class="articleinfo">Come Monday, the Treasure Valley could see its first rainy Memorial Day in four years.The recent bout of rainfall adds to the already wetter-than-average year. And it’s not expected to stop any time soon. “Based on what I’m seeing, I do not think we’re going to see blue skies and sunshine in the high 80s this weekend,” said Roland Steadham, chief meteorologist for CBS 2 News. So far this month, Boise has received 1.38 inches of rain — more than the typical 1.39 inches throughout the entire month of May. In comparison, Boise last May saw a total of 1.88 inches.
            We’re still nowhere near Boise’s May record of 4.9 inches of precipitation in 1896, according to National Weather Service records. More recently, Boise had 4.4 inches of precipitation in May 1998.
           The National Weather Services’ Boise office anticipates the cool, wet trend to stick around until next week, with a chance of showers and some isolated thunderstorms each afternoon between this Friday and Monday. This is the first consistent rain surge since the beginning of April, said Katy Branham, meteorologist with Boise’s National Weather Service. Before last week, the valley experienced a roughly monthlong dry spell, which brought warmer temperatures through most of April and early May, which Steadham called unusual. Boise’s year-to-date precipitation still remains well above average, having received 9.37 inches of precipitation since the beginning of this year — the average for this time is 6.24 inches. Branham said the weather service is seeing similar trends across the southwest portion of the state, including McCall.“It has been a fairly wet beginning portion of the year,” Branham said. “Surely that will have some impact as we carry through.”</p>
