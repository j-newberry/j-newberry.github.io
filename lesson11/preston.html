            <h2 id="content" class="article_title">Preston, Idaho residents look back on 'Napoleon Dynamite'</h2>
            <p id="content" class="articleinfo">Twelve years ago, Preston was a town like any other, a relatively quiet part of southern 
                Idaho with a population of just under 5,000 people. Known for That Famous Preston Night Rodeo and its close proximity to 
                the site of the Bear River Massacre, most of the United States would likely have been unable to locate it on a map. Things
                 would change for the small Franklin County town with the release of "Napoleon Dynamite" in 2004. The quotable comedy film 
                 written and directed by Preston native Jared Hess became a surprise hit, earning $46.1 million at the box office on a 
                 budget of only $400,000. As the site of the film, Preston gained a foothold in pop culture, the Herald Journal reported.
                "Some people worry that the movie gives us a bad name," Preston resident Rhonda Gregerson said. "But really, it gives us 
                a great name. The movie put us right on the map; it's our golden goose."</p><br>
                <p id="content" class="articleinfo"> Overnight, fans from all over the world descended onto Preston 
                    to tour all the places where the movie had been filmed, from the houses of the main characters to the multicolored 
                    lockers at Preston High School. Even 12 years past the movie's wide theatrical release, Gregerson said, every summer at 
                    least 50 groups of fans walk into the office of The Preston Citizen, the local newspaper where she works as the 
                    circulation manager, wanting to know more about the film. "They come from all over the place," Gregerson said. "In 
                    the beginning it was just from the state, but as the movie became more popular, they started coming from all over the 
                    world. Germany, England, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, China . they've all come in and have been serious fans." Although
                    The Preston Citizen wasn't used as a film site, the newsroom nevertheless continues to serve as something of a hub for
                    visiting fans as they tour the settings of their favorite scenes. Until recently, the office sold souvenirs from the
                    movie, including "Vote for Pedro" T-shirts, tubes of ChapStick, boondoggles and more. "I think we've had fans from 
                    all 50 states stop by at one time or another," Gregerson explained. "They all get so excited. I remember one gentleman
                    spent about $200 on souvenirs without batting an eye."</p><br>
